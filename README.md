# kalaha
A WIP terminal based implementation in C of the Kalah[a] board game, also known as Mancala.

As there exist lots of variations of the game, this is an implementation of just one of them.

## TODO:
- Finish this doc
- Write documentation for everything lol
- Ability to actually play with the computer
- Difficulty settings
